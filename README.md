#Sapphire
Sapphire is/will be a general purpose "modularised" bot for discord, built with Ruby and using https://github.com/meew0/discordrb

##Info
Version = 0.1.0

Ruby version 2.2+ required

Audio playback only works on one server as of now, running on another one will overwrite the file (playback will change, but the bot shouldn't
  have any issues and continue playing)

##Install/Guide
```
gem install bundler
bundler
```
Lots of audio stuff is needed for this, depends on your linux system and repo's
(No help from me for windows/mac users, sorry)
```
libsodium (python3-nacl and libsodium-dev worked for me)
libopus (libopusfile0 and libopus0 worked for me)
ffmpeg
```
Install https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl
```
sudo curl -L https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
```
Yes, I am aware there are a few gems but I found working directly with it was so much easier
